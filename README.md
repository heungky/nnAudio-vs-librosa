# Step-by-step tutorial for nnAudio


There are 3 part of tutorial:
* [Part 1: Training a Linear model with nnAudio Trainable Basis Functions](#Part-1)
* [Part 2: Evaluation with nnAudio Trainable Basis Functions](#Part-2)
* [Part 3: Using nnAudio Trainable Basis Functions with others non-linear model](#Part-3)

## Part 1
In part 1 tutorial, we will demonstrate how to utilise nnAudio trainable basis functions by using  Google speech commands dataset v2 with linear model in Key Word Spotting (KWS) task.


## Part 2
In part 2 tutorial, we will evaluate the model performance and do visualization by using the trained model weight from tutorial 1.

## Part 3
After following part 1 & 2 tutorial, you have a big picture with nnAudio trainable basis functions already. In the  part 3 tutorial, you can try to apply trainable basis functions in your own model.
